		<p>
			This project is an improved version of <a href="https://students.cs.ucl.ac.uk/2019/group24/index.html">last year's team 24 project</a>.
			Specifically, we build upon their code and add a number of new client requirements, as well as improving existing installation process.
		</p>

		<p>
			We also have a third year student&mdash;Brandon Tan&mdash;working on this project at the same time. Our team and the third year student
			focus on different tasks, and we will indicate requirements that are not ours with <span class="breq">a light colour</span>.
		</p>

		<h2>Background</h2>

		<p>
			In short, the virtual assistant project is about building a digital avatar that is displayed on a lab TV/screen that visitors to
			and workers in the lab can interact with via voice command. The assistant should be able to give user an introduction to the lab and
			the company, and be able to handle different queries about the lab or the company.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, if the company organizes a VR workshop in the lab, after being led to the lab by reception, visitors should be able to ask the
			assistant about what happens next, where to go, etc. and possibly also have the assistant help demostrate some of the VR features in the lab.
		</p>

		<h2>Requirements</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Improve background
				<p>
					Currently the avatar shows on an empty background. We plan to add some natural feature matching current weather.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				Keeping user engaged while waiting for a response
				<p>
					This could involve the use of some loading animation
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				Reporting
				<p>
					The client suggested a monitoring interface to show usage of the assistant.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				IoT integration
				<p>
					This would involve making the assistant able to control building lights, etc.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				Navigation
				<p>
					Visitors to the lab should be able to ask the assistant where to go for a certain place or event, and the assistant
					should be able to show a map, along with voice directions.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				Simplify installation
				<p>
					Currently, setting up the assistant involves the deployment of multiple moving pieces (see <a href="#system-design"># System Design</a>).
					Ideally this should be improved to a one-click install and run.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				Configurable 3D model
				<p>
					Currently the assistant have only one 3D form. We aim to be able to support using multiple models, so that
					the company or the user can choose the 3D avatar they like the most.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="breq">
				Lip sync
				<p>
					One of Brandon's major requirement, to make the mouth show the correct shape when Alexa is speaking.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="breq">
				Emotions / expressions
				<p>
					Also one of Brandon's area, to make the avatar able to convey appropiate emotions to the user via facial features.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="breq">
				Translation / act as a translator
			</li>
			<li class="breq">
				More responsive AI
			</li>
			<li class="breq">
				Display user input
			</li>
		</ul>
